# Take input for the first complex number c1
a=complex(input("c1: "))
# Take input for the second complex number c2
b=complex(input("c2: "))
# perform + operation on the complex numbers and print the result
print("a1 + b2 =",a+b)
# subtract c2 from c1 and print the result
print("a1 - b2 =",a-b)
# multiple c1, c2 and print the result
print("a1 * b2 =",a*b)
# divide c2 from c1 and print the result
print("a1 / b2 =",a/b)
